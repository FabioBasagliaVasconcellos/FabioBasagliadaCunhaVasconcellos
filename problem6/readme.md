Solution:

    A ["User performs action"] --> B["Action is completed"]
    B --> C["Dispatch API call to server"]
    C --> D{"Server validates the action"}
    D -- "Valid" --> E["Updates user score in database"]
    D -- "Invalid" --> F["Reject score update"]
    E --> G["Updates scoreboard in real time"]
    G --> H["Checks if the user entered the TOP 10"]
    H -- "Yes" --> I["Update TOP 10 list"]
    H -- "No" --> J["Maintains current TOP 10 list"]
    I --> K["Sends update to all connected clients"]
    J --> K
    F --> L["Record invalid attempt for review"]

    Important points to consider when implementing:

1. Server-side validation: All actions that affect the score must be validated on the server-side to prevent unauthorized manipulations.
2. Real-time update: Use technologies such as WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to keep the scoreboard updated in real time for all users.
3. Database Consistency: Ensure score updates are atomic to avoid race conditions.
4. Caching: Implement a caching system for the TOP 10 to reduce the load on the database.
5. Security: Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API calls.
6. Logging: Maintain detailed logs of all actions and score updates for auditing and detecting suspicious behavior.
7. Scalability: Design the system to handle a large number of users and simultaneous updates.
